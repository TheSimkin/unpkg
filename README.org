#+TITLE: unpkg
#+LATEX: \pagebreak

* Overview

  ~unpkg~ is an adventure to discover what the world looks like if we approached
  portability from a different perspective:
  
  Rather than throwing out everything that isn't available everywhere, let's try
  making things run more consistently in more places.

* Why does this exist?

  Because standards like XPG, POSIX, the Single UNIX Specification exist to
  define how things *are*, not how they *should be*. ~unpkg~ is a journey to
  build a better world.

* The Platforms

  The test platforms are currently (February 2017):
  
  | Family  | Distribution | Release |
  |---------+--------------+---------|
  | BSD     | DragonFly    |     4.6 |
  | BSD     | FreeBSD      |      11 |
  | BSD     | macOS        |    12.4 |
  | BSD     | NetBSD       |     7.0 |
  | BSD     | OpenBSD      |     6.0 |
  | illumos | OmniOS       | r151014 |
  | illumos | SmartOS      | support |
  | Linux   | Alpine       |     3.5 |
  | Linux   | CentOS       |       7 |
  | Linux   | Debian       |       8 |
  | Linux   | Fedora       |      25 |
  | Linux   | OpenSUSE     |    42.2 |
  | Linux   | RHEL         |       7 |
  | Linux   | SLES         |      12 |
  | Linux   | Ubuntu       |   16.04 |
  |---------+--------------+---------|

  This is intended as a representative sample for the purposes of portability.

* Requirements

  At minimum, you'll need a working copy of ~git~. To do anything useful, you'll
  also want a compiler (~gcc~ and ~clang~ are known to work) and a copy of
  ~make~ (GNU make is known to work).

* Installation
  
  Everyone loves piping things from the internet to a shell, right?

  Assuming =/package=, =/source=, and =/commmand= exist and are writable by
  =${UNPKG_USER}= you can run:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colstrom/unpkg/develop/tool/unpkg.init | env UNPKG_USER=$(whoami) sh
  #+END_SRC

  If that seems like a lot of work, the installer can do that for you, if you
  run it as root.

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    # as root
    export UNPKG_LET_ME_RUN_ARBITRARY_CODE_FROM_THE_INTERNET_AS_ROOT=true
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colstrom/unpkg/develop/tool/unpkg.init | sh
  #+END_SRC

* Usage

  - Add =/command= to your PATH.
  - Run ~unpkg~ to see a list of available packages.
  - Run ~unpkg <package>~, where =<package>= is a package you want.

* License

  ~unpkg~ is available under the [[https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license][MIT License]]. See ~LICENSE.txt~ for the full text.
